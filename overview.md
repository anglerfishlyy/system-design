HOrizontal scaling = adding more servers
Vertical scaling = increasing the size of that single server

Load balancing is main for distributed systems, 


two types , high level and low level system design 


Consistent hashing is a way to handle to loads in a better way using "Ring of hash" , still if a server goes down, all requests will be handled by the next servers , and that's not good.

if there are less servers , that means less breakpoints , henceforth not better (since the load is being skewed)
